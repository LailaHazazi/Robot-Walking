the steps to control servo motors to create the walking motion for a robot

1. Determine the number of servo motors required to execute the walking motion. Typically, there are 6 servo motors, 2 in each leg.

2. Establish a walking gait plan, which includes the proper sequence of motion for each leg (lift, swing forward, and place on the ground) to achieve balance and stability.

3. Assign each servo motor to a specific point in the leg or foot to execute the planned walking motion.

4. Program each servo motor to move the leg or foot to the required angle at the appropriate time, according to the walking gait plan.

5. Coordinate the motion of the servo motors to synchronize the complete walking action in a smooth and balanced manner.

6. Test the walking motion and make any necessary adjustments to the servo angles and timing.
